Proposed Git Workflow Architecture

Main Branches:

1. main: The main production branch where stable code is deployed.
2. develop: The integration branch for features and bug fixes. This branch should always be stable and ready for release.

Supporting Branches:

1. feature/*: Branches for developing new features.
2. bugfix/*: Branches for fixing bugs.
3. release/*: Branches for preparing a new release.
4. hotfix/*: Branches for urgent fixes in the production.

Workflow:

1. Developers create feature/* branches from the develop branch.
2. Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into develop.
3. When the release date (25th of every month) is approaching, a release/* branch is created from develop.
4. Final testing and minor fixes are applied to the release/* branch.
5. On the 25th, the release/* branch is merged into main and tagged for release.
6. Any hotfixes needed for the production are made in hotfix/* branches, merged into both main and develop.
7. Pseudo Code Files and Branch Simulation


1. Setup Repository:

git init zendriix-softwares
cd zendriix-softwares
git checkout -b develop


2. Create a Feature Branch:

git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
# Add pseudo code for user authentication
echo "class UserAuth {}" > user_auth.py
git add user_auth.py
git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"
git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-authentication


3. Create Another Feature Branch:

git checkout -b feature/payment-gateway
# Add pseudo code for payment gateway
echo "class PaymentGateway {}" > payment_gateway.py
git add payment_gateway.py
git commit -m "Add payment gateway feature"
git checkout develop
git merge feature/payment-gateway


4.Create a Release Branch:

git checkout -b release/1.0.0
# Perform final testing and fixes
echo "# Version 1.0.0" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Prepare release 1.0.0"


5. Merge Release Branch into Main:

git checkout main
git merge release/1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"


6. Create a Hotfix Branch (if needed):

git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix
# Fix urgent issue
echo "fix critical bug" >> critical_fix.py
git add critical_fix.py
git commit -m "Fix critical issue"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/urgent-fix
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/urgent-fix


This workflow ensures that:

1. Features are developed in isolation.
2. The develop branch is always in a stable state and ready for the next release.
3. Releases are prepared and finalized in release/* branches, ensuring the main branch only contains production-ready code.
4. Hotfixes can be quickly applied to both main and develop branches to ensure stability in production and continuity in development.
5. This architecture will help Zendriix Softwares manage their product releases effectively, ensuring consistent and stable releases on the 25th of every month.
